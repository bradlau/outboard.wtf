		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Soft-launching <strong>Outboard</strong> on the heels of <a href="https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/">the news</a> that Jonny Ive&rsquo;s io company will merge with OpenAI, and his design consultancy, LoveFrom, &ldquo;will assume deep design and creative responsibilities across OpenAI and io&rdquo; seems like a fine place to start, so here we go!</p>
<p>Many will be cynical about this announcement, but the hopeless optimist in me is excited to see what they&rsquo;re cookin'.</p>
<p>But why am I bringing <strong>Outboard</strong> to life today? Well, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the future of computing experiences a lot lately, and the discourse I&rsquo;m seeing is just way too hand-wavey for my comfort level.</p>
<p>So, expect <strong>Outboard</strong> to focus on the interactions and experiences that are becoming available as we continue to move away from WIMP (windows, icons, menus, and pointers) and into a (hopefully) more empathic, conversational world of computing experiences.</p>
